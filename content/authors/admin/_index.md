I am PhD student at the University of Neuchâtel, with a focus on financial markets. Specifically, I study how microstructure variables impact asset prices and participate in price formation. In my [working paper](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4377151), I propose a theory where prices are formed in a purely mechanical manner through trading and derive testable predictions about the joint relationships among trading volume, price impact, trading frequency, bid-ask spreads, order imbalance, market depth, and volatility.

I am also passionate about interdisciplinary projects and computational methods. In particular, I am the developer of [COVID-19 Data Hub](https://covid19datahub.io) ([Scientific Data](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01245-1)), I have authored a [classification algorithm](https://bornrule.eguidotti.com) inspired by Born's rule ([NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2022/poster/54723)), and I maintain several [R and Python packages](/coding/) including a package for high dimensional numerical and symbolic calculus in R ([JSS](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v104.i05)). For my contributions, I have received grants and awards from [IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/), the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/), and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/edu/researchers).
