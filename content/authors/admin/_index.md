I am PhD student in Finance at the University of Neuchâtel. My research interests include asset pricing and market microstructure. My research focuses on how microstructure variables affect asset prices and participate in price formation. I am also partner at Algo Finance Sagl: a software house startup developing financial algorithms for the asset management industry. 

I work with R and Python, relational databases, and cloud computing. I have also written efficient SAS code to process 200+ TB of high-frequency TAQ data via the WRDS High Performance Computing Cluster.

I am passionate about interdisciplinary data science and AI projects.
