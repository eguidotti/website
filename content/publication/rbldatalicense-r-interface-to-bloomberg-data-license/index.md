# Abstract
abstract: As the technology infrastructure increases in sophistication, Bloomberg released the Data License service, the platform that delivers Bloomberg’s datasets. For the first time, users can directly program against Bloomberg’s comprehensive historical data, servicing the growing needs of data science. The RblDataLicense package aims at providing a user-friendly R interface to the Data License service. As a prerequisite, a valid Data License from Bloomberg is needed. This software and its author are in no way affiliated, endorsed, or approved by "Bloomberg" or any of its affiliates. "Bloomberg" is a registered trademark.
