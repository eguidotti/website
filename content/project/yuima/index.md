I am member of [The YUIMA Project Team](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v057.i04) since 2017. This is an open source academic project aimed at developing a complete environment for estimation and simulation of stochastic differential equations and other stochastic processes via the R package called [yuima](https://cran.r-project.org/package=yuima). 

In my MSc thesis, I developed [yuimaGUI](https://cran.r-project.org/package=yuimaGUI), the Graphical User Interface for [yuima](https://cran.r-project.org/package=yuima), under the supervision of [S.M. Iacus](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JBs9tJ4AAAAJ&hl=en).

I am now working with [N. Yoshida](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LiebdNAAAAAJ&hl=en) on the implementation of asymptotic expansion formulas for diffusion processes that would enable to approximate the transition density with arbitrary degree of accuracy.
