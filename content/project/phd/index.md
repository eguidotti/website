I am PhD student with the Institute of Financial Analysis at the University of Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, supervised by [T.A. Kroencke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ca_UmBoAAAAJ&hl=en).
My thesis consists of three papers in empirical asset pricing and market microstructure. The thesis investigates how microstructure variables affect asset prices.

In the first paper, I develop an efficient estimator of the bid-ask spread from open, high, low, and close prices. The second paper estimates bid-ask spreads for the U.S. stock market since 1926 and it studies the role of the spread in the cross-section of stock returns. In the third paper, I propose a theoretical model of the limit order book and empirically test its implications in the price formation process. The first paper is available at SSRN. 

For the empirical analyses, I mainly rely on the CRSP and COMPUSTAT databases. I have also written efficient SAS code to process 200+ TB of high-frequency TAQ data via the WRDS High Performance Computing Cluster.
