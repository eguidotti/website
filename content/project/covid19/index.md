In early 2020, I started a [project](https://covid19datahub.io) to provide the research community with a unified dataset by collecting worldwide fine-grained case data, merged with exogenous variables helpful for a better understanding of COVID-19.

The first prototype of the dataset was used in a [joint paper]({{< relref "/publication/are-official-confirmed-cases-and-fatalities-counts-good-enough-to-study-the-covid-19-pandemic-dynamics-a-critical-assessment-through-the-case-of-italy" >}}) with [K. Bartoszek](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=pfJpxV4AAAAJ&hl=en), [S.M. Iacus](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JBs9tJ4AAAAJ&hl=en), and [M. Okr√≥j](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ygz9dVUAAAAJ&hl=en). In April 2020, the project was funded by the Canadian Institute for Data Valorization IVADO thanks to the collaboration with [D. Ardia](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=BPNrOUYAAAAJ&hl=en). The project won the CovidR contest in May, it was presented at the European R Users Meeting in June, and it was published in the [Journal of Open Source Software]({{< relref "/publication/covid-19-data-hub" >}}) in July. The latest version of the dataset is described in [_A worldwide epidemiological database for COVID-19 at fine-grained spatial resolution_]({{< relref "/publication/a-worldwide-epidemiological-database-for-covid-19-at-fine-grained-spatial-resolution" >}}). 

The dataset has been downloaded millions of times and it has enabled a variety of [academic studies](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=1585537563493742217). This project is now supported by the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org).
