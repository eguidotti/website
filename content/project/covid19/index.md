In early 2020, I started a [project](https://covid19datahub.io) to provide the research community with a unified dataset by collecting worldwide fine-grained case data, merged with exogenous variables helpful for a better understanding of COVID-19.

The first prototype of the dataset was used in a joint paper with [K. Bartoszek](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=pfJpxV4AAAAJ&hl=en), [S.M. Iacus](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JBs9tJ4AAAAJ&hl=en), and [M. Okr√≥j](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ygz9dVUAAAAJ&hl=en). The project was funded in April by the Canadian Institute for Data Valorization IVADO thanks to the collaboration with [D. Ardia](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=BPNrOUYAAAAJ&hl=en), it won the CovidR contest in May, it was presented at the European R Users Meeting in June, and it was published in the Journal of Open Source Software in July. The latest version of the dataset is described in _A worldwide epidemiological database for COVID-19 at fine-grained spatial resolution_. The dataset has been downloaded millions of times and it has enabled a variety of [academic studies](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=1585537563493742217). This project is now supported by the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org).
